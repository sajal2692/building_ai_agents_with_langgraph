    "# Building a Report Writing Agentic System using Reflection\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build a report writing agent that utilizes reflection to iteratively improve its output. By leveraging reflection, the agent can critique its own work and refine it in subsequent iterations, leading to a higher-quality final report.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is inspired by the concept of reflection in LLM agent building, where the agent observes its past outputs and assesses the quality of its actions to enhance future performance.\n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "Our report writing agent will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate an initial report based on a user-provided topic.\n",
    "2. Reflect on the generated report by critiquing its content, structure, and style.\n",
    "3. Iterate the process by incorporating the reflections to improve the report.\n",
    "4. Repeat the reflection and revision steps for a set number of iterations or until the report meets a desired quality threshold.\n",
